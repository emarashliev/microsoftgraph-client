      summary: Get a user
      description: 'Retrieve the properties and relationships of user object. This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These default properties are noted in the Properties section. To get properties that are not returned by default, do a GET operation for the user and specify the properties in a $select OData query option. Because the user resource supports extensions, you can also use the GET operation to get custom properties and extension data in a user instance. Customers through Microsoft Entra ID for customers can also use this API operation to retrieve their details.'
